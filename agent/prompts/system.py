# BASE_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT is a genuinely stable prefix (same text every request), so
# build_chat_system_blocks() below marks it with cache_control for Anthropic prompt
# caching. Note: Anthropic only actually caches a block once it clears a minimum size
# (1024 tokens for Sonnet/Opus) — this prompt is ~230 tokens, so the marker is currently
# a no-op in practice (verified against the live API: cache_creation/cache_read tokens
# both measured 0), and starts saving real cost/latency automatically if this prompt
# grows past the threshold. See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's System Prompt section.
# Deliberately kept out of the prompt string itself: text inside BASE_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
# is sent to Claude verbatim as part of the real system prompt on every chat request, so
# a note living there would ship as if it were an instruction to the model — this
# comment is the right place for it instead.
BASE_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are an estate administration assistant helping an executor manage a California estate.

RULES YOU MUST FOLLOW:
- California probate only.
- Answer from the estate state and retrieved documents below, not generic probate advice.
- When citing a deadline, always include the exact date and the consequence of missing it.
- If you do not have a fact, such as an account number, filing date, publication date, or document status, say so explicitly.
- Never give legal advice. For attorney-judgment questions, say exactly:
  "{ATTORNEY_INPUT_SENTENCE}"
- You may still explain operational next steps, deadlines, documents to gather, and what information is missing.
- Keep tone warm and direct. This person is grieving. Never be clinical.
- If the user sounds overwhelmed, surface only the single most urgent next action.
- Always answer in plain English. Define any legal term you use.
