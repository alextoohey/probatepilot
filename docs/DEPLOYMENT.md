# Deployment

ProbatePilot is two services: the Python agent (`agent/`) and the Next.js
frontend (`web/`). Deploy the agent first, then point the frontend at it.

Everything here is optional beyond `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` — the app is
designed to degrade gracefully. See [`agent/.env.example`](../agent/.env.example) and
[`web/.env.local.example`](../web/.env.local.example) for the full, authoritative list of
what each key unlocks.

## 1. Deploy the agent (Render)

A `render.yaml` blueprint is included at the repo root.

1. Provision a [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/) instance first (Redis 8, for its
   Vector Sets support — the free tier is enough). You'll need its connection string for
   the next step. Never put a real value in a committed file — see
   [`docs/database.md`](database.md#never-commit-a-real-redis_url) for why.
2. Push this repo to your own GitHub account.
3. In the [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), choose **New +** →
   **Blueprint**, and point it at your fork.
4. Render reads `render.yaml` and provisions a free web service from
   `agent/Dockerfile`. It will prompt for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `REDIS_URL` (both
   required) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional) at first deploy.
5. Once live, note the service URL (`https://probatepilot-agent-xxxx.onrender.com`).
   Confirm it's healthy: `curl https://<your-service>.onrender.com/health`.

**Any Docker host works the same way** — `agent/Dockerfile` builds standalone
(`docker build -f agent/Dockerfile -t probatepilot-agent .` from the repo
root) and reads `$PORT` at runtime, so Railway, Fly.io, and Cloud Run all work
without changes.

**Why Redis Cloud instead of the default `STORE_BACKEND=memory`:** the memory backend
keeps all estate data, including real registered accounts (not just the demo estate), in
the container's RAM. Render's free tier spins the container down after 15 minutes idle and
starts a clean process on the next request — memory-backed data doesn't survive that, so a
real account made yesterday would just be gone. `render.yaml` defaults to
`STORE_BACKEND=redis_cloud` for exactly this reason; `memory` is still fine for local dev
or a throwaway demo where that reset is acceptable.

## 2. Deploy the frontend (Vercel)

1. In [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), import the same fork with **Root
   Directory** set to `web/`.
2. Set the one required env var:
   - `AGENT_API_URL` = the Render service URL from step 1
3. Optional env vars (voice and error tracking degrade cleanly without them):
   `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ORG`,
   `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your Vercel URL, used for
   metadata/share links).
4. Deploy. Vercel auto-detects Next.js — no build config needed.

## 3. Seed the demo estate

The live app is empty until the demo estate exists. Either:

- Click **Try the demo** on the deployed `/welcome` page (this calls
  `POST /auth/demo` on the agent, which seeds it on first use), or
- Seed it directly: `curl -X POST https://<your-agent>.onrender.com/seed`

## Notes

- **Free-tier cold starts**: Render's free plan spins down after 15 minutes
  idle and takes ~30–60s to wake on the next request. The first load after
  idle will feel slow — this is Render, not the app.
- **CORS**: the frontend never calls the agent directly from the browser —
  every request is proxied through Next.js API routes (`web/app/api/agent/[...path]`),
  which forward the session cookie as a Bearer token server-side. No CORS
  configuration is needed on the agent.
- **Vercel function timeout**: that same proxy route sets `export const maxDuration = 60`
  because `POST /deadline-agent`'s Claude-enhanced pass takes ~30-45s, longer than
  Vercel's serverless default (10s on Hobby). Already handled in the code — nothing to
  configure — but worth knowing if you ever see that call fail only in production and not
  locally/on Render, where there's no such limit.
- **Auth**: every estate-scoped endpoint requires a session and ownership, no exceptions —
  "Try the demo" is automated, not unauthenticated: it mints a real session on a fresh,
  independent copy of the seed estate for that visitor only, so no registration form is
  needed but every visitor still owns their own isolated estate. See `agent/api/deps.py`
  and `agent/api/routers/auth.py`'s `demo_login()`. The one true exception is the canonical
  `demo-milligan` record itself, which stays world-readable for `/seed`-based testing.

## Known follow-up: Next.js / Sentry major version upgrade

`npm audit` currently reports advisories against `next` (`^14.2.0`) and
`@sentry/nextjs` (`^8.30.0`) — both packages are already pinned to the newest
release in their installed major version (`next@14.2.35`, `@sentry/nextjs@8.55.2`),
so there's no drop-in patch available; clearing these requires a major-version
upgrade (`next` 14→16, `@sentry/nextjs` 8→10) with real breaking-change review
(App Router changes, Sentry config API changes), not a one-command fix. Several
of the `next` advisories are specifically about self-hosted production behavior
(request smuggling in rewrites, SSRF via WebSocket upgrades, cache poisoning),
so this is worth doing as a dedicated, tested piece of work before this app
handles real traffic — not folded into an unrelated change.

## Known follow-up: Email delivery

The email pipeline (`agent/notify/email.py`) is fully built and tested — real Resend
integration, human-toned weekly recap / alert digest templates, graceful degradation to a
preview when unconfigured. The "Send weekly recap" and "Email me copies" controls are
hidden in the UI (`EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED = false` in
`web/components/screens/NotificationsMenu.tsx`) rather than shipped half-working, for one
specific reason: Resend's sandbox sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`) only delivers to the
account owner's own address until a domain is verified. Without that, the feature would
only ever work for whoever owns the Resend account — not an arbitrary logged-in user or a
recruiter trying the demo — which reads as broken rather than gated.

To turn it back on once a domain is available:

1. Buy or claim a domain (GitHub Student Developer Pack includes a free `.me` domain via
   Namecheap if eligible; otherwise a cheap TLD from Namecheap/Porkbun/Cloudflare runs
   $1–15/year).
2. Verify it with Resend (Dashboard → Domains → Add Domain, then add the SPF/DKIM DNS
   records they provide).
3. Set `EMAIL_FROM=ProbatePilot <notifications@yourdomain.com>` in `agent/.env` and
   restart the agent — `send_email()` already passes `EMAIL_FROM` straight through to
   Resend's `from` field, so no code change is needed there.
4. Flip `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` back to `true` in `NotificationsMenu.tsx`.
5. Make sure `NOTIFY_OVERRIDE_RECIPIENT` is unset in the deployed environment — it's a
   local-testing escape hatch that forces every recipient to one address, which would
   misroute every real user's email to the developer's inbox if left on.

This is a "buy/verify a domain" gap, not an engineering one — worth revisiting once this
is actually deployed and worth the ~$10-15/year, not before.
