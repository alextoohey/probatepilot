# ProbatePilot

**An AI copilot that keeps estate executors ahead of every probate deadline.**

Built in 24 hours at UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2026 by a 4-person team, for the
technology-and-social-impact track.

## The problem

When someone dies, the **executor** — usually a grieving family member, not a lawyer — is
personally on the hook for administering the estate: probate filings, an asset inventory,
creditor notices, debts paid in a specific legal order, taxes, distributions. Miss a
deadline, or pay creditors out of order, and the executor can be held *personally* liable
for the mistake. Most families can't afford a probate attorney for every question, so they
do this alone — typically over 100+ hours, with no one telling them what's coming next.

ProbatePilot reads the estate's documents, builds a live picture of what's known and what's
missing, and tells the executor the next action *before* it becomes expensive. It's scoped
to California probate law for now, and it knows what it doesn't know: for anything requiring
legal judgment, it says so plainly instead of guessing.

## What it does

- **Upload a document, get a structured estate.** A will, a deed, a bank statement, a
  creditor notice — Claude reads it and extracts the assets, debts, beneficiaries, and dates
  into one running estate record.
- **The DeadlineAgent watches the clock.** A deterministic California probate rule engine
  evaluates the estate against real statutory deadlines (DE-160 inventory, the 30-day
  creditor-notice window, debt payment order, and more); Claude then reasons over the result
  to rank and explain it in plain language. The rules always win — Claude can rewrite the
  copy, never the facts.
- **Ask it anything.** An estate-aware chat (text or voice) answers questions grounded in
  the executor's own uploaded documents, not generic advice.
- **It writes the letters.** Creditor notices, bank notifications, beneficiary updates —
  drafted from the estate's actual facts, ready to sign.

```

Two services, one shared store, each language doing what it's good at: Python owns Claude
reasoning and document parsing, TypeScript owns everything the user touches. The browser
never talks to the Python service directly — every call is proxied through Next.js, which
forwards the session as a bearer token server-side, so there's no CORS surface to manage.

**A few things worth a closer look if you're reading the code:**

- **The DeadlineAgent is deterministic-first.** `evaluate_rules()` runs a pure-function rule
  table against estate state and always produces a complete, correct alert set — with zero
  LLM involvement. Claude then gets a bounded tool-use loop to improve the wording, but its
  output is validated against the deterministic alerts and rejected if it drops or invents
  one. A missing API key or a bad model response both degrade to the same rule-evaluated
  alerts, just plainer prose. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **The store is a real backend abstraction, not a wrapper around one database.**
  `agent/store/` supports three interchangeable backends — in-memory (default, zero setup),
  Upstash Redis, and Redis Cloud with Redis 8 Vector Sets for semantic search — behind one
  API, selected by an env var.
- **Auth is session-based with real ownership checks, including in the demo.** Every
  estate-scoped endpoint requires a session and verifies the caller owns that estate — the
  demo is not an exception to this, it's automated: "Try the demo" mints a real session on a
  fresh, independent copy of the seed estate for that visitor only (self-expiring, no
  registration form), so one visitor's edits never show up for another.
- **Every Claude and OpenAI call is traced.** Phoenix spans wrap the full agent loop
  (`estate_id`, rules checked, fallback used, tool calls); an LLM-as-judge eval
  (`agent/evals/deadline_next_steps_quality.py`) scores the DeadlineAgent's output quality
  on real traces. Tracing is optional and degrades to a harmless connection warning with
  no collector running — see [`agent/README.md`](agent/README.md#phoenix-tracing) to spin
  one up locally and actually watch the traces.

  <img src="docs/assets/phoenix-trace.png" width="70%" alt="Phoenix trace of a real DeadlineAgent tool-use call: system prompt, model, cost, tokens, and latency" />

  A real trace from a live run: the DeadlineAgent's tool-use loop (left), the exact
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` system prompt sent, and per-call cost/token/latency ($0.01, 3,977
  tokens, 2.8s for this step).
- **The DeadlineAgent's Claude calls use real prompt caching.** Its system prompt and tool
  schemas (~1,066 tokens, reused across up to 5 tool-use rounds per run) carry an Anthropic
  `cache_control` marker and measurably hit cache on repeat calls
  (`cache_read_input_tokens=1066`, verified live against the API, not assumed). The chat
  prompt is wired the same way but is currently under Anthropic's 1024-token cache-eligibility
  floor, so it's a documented no-op today rather than an overclaimed win — see
  [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#system-prompt-chat).
- **Two features are built but intentionally not exposed yet.** An email digest pipeline
  (Resend, human-toned templates, on-demand send) is fully working but gated behind a
  verified sending domain — see [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#known-follow-up-email-delivery).
  A `ResearchAgent` prototype exists but currently relies on unofficial news search with no
  real relevance judgment and isn't wired to any trigger — a source-verified redesign
  (poll the actual CA statute/form pages this app's own rules cite, diff their amendment
  dates) is fully scoped in [`docs/RESEARCH_AGENT_REDESIGN.md`](docs/RESEARCH_AGENT_REDESIGN.md),
  not yet built.

| **AI** | Anthropic Claude (parsing, agent reasoning, chat, letters) · OpenAI embeddings |
| **Backend** | Python · FastAPI · Pydantic v2 · bcrypt · Resend (email) |

## Quick start

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (manages the Python 3.11+ interpreter itself, no
separate install needed) and Node 18.18+ (`web/.nvmrc` pins 20 if you use nvm).

```bash
make env       # copy .env examples (won't overwrite existing files)
make install   # uv sync for agent/ (agent/uv.lock), npm install for web/ (web/package-lock.json)
make dev       # agent on :8000, web on :3000
```

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `agent/.env` is the only key the app requires to run at all — Redis,
Deepgram, Resend, and Phoenix are all genuinely optional and degrade cleanly when unset (the
default `STORE_BACKEND=memory` is a real, fully-working store, not a stub — it just doesn't
persist across restarts; without `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, the mic button tells you voice isn't set
up instead of silently doing nothing). `OPENAI_API_KEY` is a step above the rest, though:
without it, chat still runs rather than erroring, but retrieval falls back to a deterministic
hashing-trick bag-of-words vector instead of a real embedding — it still finds chunks that
share literal words with the query (better than nothing), just no understanding of synonyms
or paraphrasing. Set it too if you want the RAG chat to demonstrate genuinely grounded,
semantically-relevant answers. See [`agent/.env.example`](agent/.env.example) for the full
list.

```bash
make test      # Python + TypeScript contract tests
make lint      # ruff (agent/) + ESLint (web/)
```

**Trying it out**: click "Try the demo" for the fastest path — no signup, seeded estate,
alerts already firing. To see the document-intelligence pipeline itself run end to end,
register a real account instead and upload a few files from
[`examples/`](examples/README.md) — it includes a numbered happy-path order and a note on
which document types the parser recognizes today.

## Deploying your own

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) — Render for the agent (a `render.yaml`
blueprint is included), Vercel for the frontend, one required env var on each side.
